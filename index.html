            <p class="bio">I'm a third year Computer Science student who hopes to impact education for the better
              as an up and coming Software Engineer. Growing up, I've always done well in school but I always wanted to help
              those around me do as well as I did. In elementary school, it started out as small discussions between and after class about math and science.
              In high school, it grew to after school peer tutoring in math and working part-time at Kumon. In university, I developed software for George Brown College and
              developed educational games at SMART Technologies. Every job I've had has been related to education and I've learned so much
              and had an amazing time at each one. I dream of a class where students will be able to learn material without the tensions of grades and exams.
              A class where students will be able to co-discover and understand the topics through guided learning and teacher facilitation.
              I believe that software will aid in bringing this dream to reality.</p>
